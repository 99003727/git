## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Merging code overcame by creating separate branch and merging to master.
2. Make all command overcame by making separate header file, separate .c file and source file.
3. Conversion of angular coordinate to cartesion coordinate in which value of pi goes out of bound by defining the constant value of pi. 
4. including the headers and to merge the code from local branch to master.
